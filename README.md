# Static HTML / CSS

You are expected to develop a one-page website for a client.
The goal of the website is to advertise a one-day music concert where multiple different artists will perform.

Within the media files, the client already provides you some media, icons, and text.
You are free to use them but can also create them on your own as long as the website still fulfills the purpose.

Do not use any libaries and frameworks for this task.

The website should be responsive and support at least the following viewports:

- Mobile: 360x640
- Tablet: 768x1024
- Desktop: 1920x1080

The clients wants to support the two most used browsers: Google Chrome and Firefox.

## MVP

For the MVP, the client wants a simple landing page that engages users to get interested in the music concert and check back when the full website with all information is available.

The client's vision for the landing page is that the website uses exactly the full width and height of the browser so there is no empty space and also no scrolling needed.
Some kind of media should also be used to attract users.

Additionally, the following information must be visible:

- Name of the event: **Stars in Graz**
- Date of the music concert: **30.10.2021**
- Location of the music concert: **Messe Congress Graz**
- Date when the full website with all the information will be available: **25.09.2021**

All additional sections have to be placed below on the same page and it has to be clear to the user that they can scroll down to see more. The navigation menu can also be placed over the existing landing page section.

The following additional sections are required:

- A navigation menu with links to all the other sections
- The concert schedule
- Purchase tickets button (it does not have to point to a valid URL, the client will update it on their own)
- At least one testimonial from a visitor from last year
- Frequently asked questions

Texts for the sections are provided within the mediafiles folder.

Once everything is ready, create a release that the client can then deploy.
